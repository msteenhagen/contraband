In east London's Cheapside stands St. Mary-le-Bow. Built on stone arches, the church is also known as St. Mary de Arcubus. Christopher Wren designed the present building right after the Great Fire of 1666. The old church was mostly destroyed in the blaze, but Wren managed to use some of the old foundations. Although Wren's building received architectural praise for its classic visual appearance, the older, original church of Bow made history mainly because of the way it made itself heard across the city: its bell defined the true Londoner. To be a veritable Cockney, people agreed, one had to be born within earshot of Bow Bell. And the bell's audibility reached far. 

In a famous satire from 1604, _The History of Richard Whittington_, the historical character of Dick Whittington (c. 1354–1423), mayor of London, decides to leave London to find his fortune elsewhere. Early in the morning, he sets out for the North. While climbing Highgate Hill, half a dozen miles from the city, he takes a break. Sat on a stone, suddenly the sounds of Bow Bell that had started to ring in the distance struck him. Listening more carefully to the distant bell, the faint sounds that reached him appeared to be voices!

> _Turn again, Whittington, Lord Mayor of London._
> 
> _Turn again, Whittington, Lord Mayor of London._

According to the story, the message Whittington believed Bow Bell to transmit took possession of him. He returned to the city promptly, trying his luck by running for Mayor. No doubt the alleged message was a mere product of Whittington's fancy. Yet that on Highgate Hill he could hear the bell way down in the city was real, and it conveys an important truth about audition. Just as in vision, in auditory perception we can perceive concrete bodies that are manifestly at a distance from us. Sitting on a stone in Highgate, Whittington could hear a bell several miles removed from him, and from there he heard it ringing all the way back in east London's Cheapside.

Audition is a distal sense. Our capacity to hear is a capacity to perceive things at locations that can be spatially removed from us. Striking about the distal senses is that they seem not to require contact with their objects. For this reason, reflection on them potentially paves the way for philosophical puzzles about how such perception is possible. We have already encountered how reflection on visual perception gave rise to such puzzlement (see \autoref{chap:problem}, p. \pageref{dis:puzzlevision}). Yet, interestingly, even though it is a distal sense, hearing has not given rise to the kind of puzzlement that vision has. For some reason, how hearing a bell in the distance is possible has seemed obvious to people.

That audition did not puzzle philosophers is not just because, traditionally, authors have taken vision for the highest or most noble of the senses. It is true that for this reason, vision has received most philosophical attention, allowing many of its puzzling features to become exposed. But the true explanation lies in something much more straightforward. Audition has proven less puzzling, because it is obvious to us that the sense of hearing is acted upon by sounds. When we reflect on what it is to hear, we can discover proximal objects of hearing that reach our ears. Indeed, over and over again, philosophers characterise hearing as a passive bombardment by sounds in our environment. <!-- ref? -->We conceive of the sounds that reach us as pounding our ears, as waking us up, and as acting on our sensory capacity to hear. The very structure of auditory experience, as a form of distal perception that is mediated by sounds, is manifest (a clear and early observation is made by Plato, _Tim._ 67\textsuperscript{b}1-4).

In what follows I will show that we already conceive of auditory perception as a form of distal perception that is mediated by sounds. When a sound makes itself present to our ears, it can confer audibility on a world beyond itself. In this way sounds play a mediating role in perception. They enable us, in the right circumstances, to hear and listen to things wholly distinct from those sounds. This in turn matters for an understanding of images. It shows that we already conceive of sensory modalities as potentially having a mediated structure. This, I suggest, helps us see what images are. Just as sounds, images play a mediating role in perception. This enables us, in the right circumstances, to see things wholly distinct from the images we are presented with in sight. To defend this novel approach to images and visual representation in more detail, we need to begin by considering what is involved in hearing the world. In particular, we need to ask what sounds are.

## Sounds

What is a sound? Sounds are emitted when an body is struck or moved in the right way. A wooden hammer causes the copper bell to vibrate for a period of time. Vibrations of that sort cause air to move in a way that gives rise to a sound. If the bell is large enough, and if it is struck with sufficient force, that sound can travel or propel all the way across a city. When those sounds reach the ears, people without hearing impairment may be able to hear them. Unlike light, which itself only becomes visible to us in exceptional circumstances, sounds are heard in any conscious act of hearing. This makes the possibility of hearing quite unproblematic, akin to the way the possibility of touching is obvious. It is manifest how distant objects can have an effect on us: by producing audible sounds.

The metaphysics of sounds is controversial. Most philosophers agree that sounds are public phenomena that do not depend on any particular mind or act of perception. Some think sounds simply are waves. Sound waves are produced when the distribution of molecules of a surrounding medium, typically air, is disrupted by some vibrating body in that medium. The disruption spreads out, and propels itself in many directions, somewhat like a ripple spreading out across the face of a pond [@oshaughnessy2000aa, p. 445]. But even if sounds spread out in this way, this does not itself imply that they are identical to waves. The wave view is controversial. Some authors suggest instead that sounds are audible individuals distinct from those waves. For instance, Casey O'Callaghan maintains that a sound is an event that a vibrating body undergoes [@ocallaghan2007aa], while Roger Scruton argues that a sound is a 'secondary object', a distinct kind of _audibile_ that, qua individual, parallels the way colour qualities are the irreducibly visible cloaks of things [@scruton2010aa; see also @oshaughnessy1972aa]. 

The dispute about the metaphysics of sounds need not be settled here. What matters is that sounds are wholly distinct from the material bodies in our environment, in a way that the visual and tactual features of material reality are not distinct from what we see or touch [cf. @ocallaghan2008aa, p. 804]. All the above positions can accept this. That sounds are distinct is already obvious in experience: in reflecting on our experience of hearing a bell in the distance, one can confirm that sounds are wholly distinct from the material bodies they make heard. They are objects of audition---_audibilia_---by means of which we can hear the material world. The distinctness of sounds can also be given a more precise formulation, so let me now turn to that.  

That sounds are audibilia means that they themselves can be heard. Indeed, sounds need to be heard in order for someone to hear anything at all. People with tinnitus merely _seem_ to hear a high-pitched tone, precisely because they do not hear any sound. We can only hear the police car in the street to the extent that some sound that reaches our ears is itself perceived. Whenever we hear concrete bodies such as a car, we always hear sounds as well. In a sense we always hear 'doubly' when we hear bodies at a distance.

That sounds are wholly distinct from the bodies they make heard means that they are neither identical to those bodies, nor have any parts in common with them, nor are properties of those bodies [see @inwagen1994aa, p. 214 for discussion of Armstrong's slightly weaker notion of wholly distinctness]. That sounds are not identical to material bodies is clear. The bell is made of copper, but its sound, though possibly a coppery one, is not made of any metal at all. Neither does the sound of the bell have any part in common with the bell or with any other body. This follows from the fact that all of a body's parts are spatially extended, while sounds lack spatially extended parts. Even though a sound can be in a space, it does not take up space. A room may become noisy if it is filled with sound, it does not in this way get crammed. Lastly, that sounds are not properties of bodies equally stands. The sound of the bell can cease or be muted without the bell undergoing any change, for instance when the surrounding medium is removed by placing the bell inside an air pump. If sounds were properties of bodies, a change to the sound would be a change to the body.

Some have resisted the manifest character of hearing. They deny that sounds are wholly distinct from bodies, appearances notwithstanding. But they generally do so because they are gripped by an argument. They think that we can only perceive something if we perceive at least some part or property of it. Perceiving something wholly distinct from it, they think, is not going to help us perceive any distant body. Now, surely we can hear distant bodies, such as the ringing bells of St. Mary-le-Bow. This has led these authors to conclude that sounds must be parts of the concrete individuals we hear, or properties of them. How else could we hear them? [for a view motivated by this worry, see @pasnau1999aa]. The problem with this line of reasoning is the contentious assumption it relies on: the assumption that we can only perceive a thing by perceiving some part or property of it. This is simply without foundation. I suspect that what drives this thought is a dogmatic conviction that perception is _uniform_.\label{dis:variationsenses} That is, that processes of perceiving must always behave in the same way. True, in paradigm cases of vision and touch we perceive objects because we perceive their properties or parts. You cannot touch a table without being in physical contact with at least one of its sides. Yet, why should we expect all perception to conform to this principle? Hearing distant bodies manifestly relies on hearing something that reaches us, while seeing and touching manifestly put us in contact with parts or properties of bodies (we manifestly reach _them_, so to say). Already these manifest differences are sufficient to resist fitting all forms of perception in a uniform mould [cf. @batty2010aa, p. 513].

Sounds are objects of audition by means of which we come to hear a distal, material world. In the next section I will discuss this specific function of sounds in perception, and bring out its relation to perceptual activity. 

## Beyond the world of sound

Discussing the different modalities of perception, J.O. Urmson writes that

> Clearly one may see, hear, feel, smell, and taste physical objects like motor cars and apples; it requires ingenious stage setting to make 'I hear an apple' or 'I taste a motor car' sound natural ... but one may certainly hear a motor car or taste an apple [@urmson1968aa, p. 117].

I think Urmson is right. Just as we can see a magpie, or taste vinegar in our salad, we can hear things such as people in the corridor, aeroplanes overhead, and a pub fight down the street. Perceiving mundane things like these is what auditory perception is for [cf. @nudds2014aa; @kalderon2012ab]. The audibility of material bodies or events depends in part on what happens to or in them. Some material bodies do not by themselves produce sounds in the way a waterfall or motor car can. Take an apple. For it to be heard it needs to partake in an event during which something happens to it; someone may throw the apple against your front door, for instance---Urmson's ingenious stage setting. By being thrown against a wood surface, apples, together with a host of other things---such as the event of the apple's being thrown, the hollow space inside the door, and perhaps the antique brass door knocker---can become audible. Urmson's point is that, allowing ingenuity, more or less anything in our surroundings can become audible to us.

We can hear mundane objects and events. This suggests a crucial duality in audition: the sense of hearing can take both sounds and everyday bodies and events as its objects. The observation that we can hear bodies moreover rules out the restrictive view, often attributed to Berkeley's mouthpiece Philonous in the _Three Dialogues_, that sounds are all we ever hear [@berkeley1954aa]. At least in the world in which we evolved, our sense of hearing goes beyond that. 

What is the relation between sounds and the other things we hear? I accept that sounds are the primary objects of awareness in audition. By this I mean that whenever we hear something, we always hear some sound. But in being heard, sounds can fulfil a crucial role in enabling us to hear other things. It is by means of sounds that we can come to hear other things. Consider the following case. When you hear an apple smash into your front door, your perception manifests a specific structure: you hear the sounds _immediately_, and you hear the fruit _mediately_. You hear the apple in virtue of a primary object of hearing, namely the sound of its impact on your door [see @jackson1977aa, p. 15ff for a seminal discussion of 'in virtue of']. The structure is one in which the sound mediates your perception of the apple. You hear the sound immediately, and you hear the apple mediately, by means of the sound. I suggest that only this structure helps explain how we can hear anything beyond sound. We cannot hear concrete bodies or physical events immediately. Sounds are the primary objects of auditory awareness, and so every auditory perception is a perception of some sound. But we can hear more than that, by means of the sounds we hear.

I want to discuss the conclusion that sounds mediate the hearing of bodies and events in more detail. How is the mediate structure of audition manifest in experience? There may not be a single answer to this question. But one feature undeniably stands out. This is how hearing sounds enables us to single out and listen to material bodies, events, and their attributes. 

Imagine that at night you are woken up by a series of noises coming from your living room. Reluctant to get out of bed, you first listen more carefully to what goes on. A high pitched squeak. A thud. Did you leave a window open? Is someone down there? Suddenly you hear a set of cushioned feet sliding over the wooden floor. You realise it's the cat. The animal must have managed to open the kitchen door, again. What is it doing? You listen more carefully. Your ears are now no longer focused on the sounds themselves, as they were initially, but instead you're listening to what is going on in the living room downstairs. On the basis of the various sounds that reach you, such as a rustle of newspapers, the clattering of some pens falling on the floor, and the sound of nails on a glass surface, you are able quite reliably to track the animal through the familiar space downstairs. In all of this, you listen in a way that is utterly dependent on the sounds that reach you. Still, importantly, the objects of your perceptual activity---hence, the objects of hearing---extend well beyond those sounds. 

Recently a number of authors have argued, both on scientific and common sense grounds, that in audition we can successfully single out, attend to, and perceptually track things that are not sounds [@ocallaghan2009aa; @matthen2010aa; @cottrell2014aa]. If this is right, then it not only underscores that audition can be of vastly more things than sounds alone. It also brings out a central role for perceptual activity in helping us to study and clarify the structure of auditory sense perception.

In general, succesfully attending to an item in perception (be it in the form of active touching, looking, or indeed listening) can be taken as a criterion for a person's perception of the item [see @crowther2009aa, 23ff for a programmatic inventory of such directed sensory activities]. That someone listens to a cat entails that they, at least for some of that time, actually hear that cat. No doubt the theoretical possibility of illusion or hallucination complicates how we can apply this criterion for perceiving. It may be that someone merely thinks they are listening to something, while in fact they are not---think of a sudden onset of tinnitus which someone mistakes for a defect in the stereo set. That there is room for error in applying the criterion does not make the criterion itself any less adequate.

Experimental psychologists have in recent years started to study the place of attention in auditory experience in more detail [for an explicit defence of the present point based on experimental results, see @nudds2014aa]. But note that this structure as such is most familiar to many of us whenever we listen to things in everyday situations. We are happy to count the case described above as one of 'hearing a cat', at least in part because it is manifest in experience that this is what we attend to and succeeded in perceiving.

<!-- Point about structure; there's is cross-modal comparison here -->
Our capacity to hear enables us to engage in perceptual activities directed at the material world [cf. @gaver1993aa]. Significantly, our capacity to hear requires perception of some intermediary object---a sound---as a precondition for the exercise of such activities. It is only by virtue of hearing a sound that you can direct your sensory attention to some object or event. <!-- Later I will emphasise that one can hear a sound without doing so.--> Auditory perception of the material world manifests a structure foreign to what we find, say, in typical visual encounters with that world. Normal audition possesses a specific 'mediated' structure that makes auditory perception of a distal environment possible. This mediated structure, instead of posing a problem for the possibility of hearing distal things, precisely enables it. <!-- Think of the terminology here. Should I already speak of a mediator sense? --> The sounds we hear enable us to listen to bodies and events wholly distinct from them. They confer audibility on a world beyond sound. Sounds function as _perceptual mediators_, as I will call them. Something functions as a perceptual mediator if perceiving it enables us to attend perceptually to some thing wholly distinct from it. 

Anyone able to hear can hear sounds: all that needs to happen is that a sound affects them strongly enough; a sound can even wake us from our sleep. In some cases, hearing distal bodies by means of sounds involves some further effort. Someone just woken up by a strange noise may not yet be able to detect the lorry that it makes audible. They may not immediately be able to hear it as the sound of that object. Coming to hear the sound in that way will typically involve listening. In such a situation, coming to hear the lorry requires us actively (though not necessarily deliberately) to direct our sensory attention. Hearing the lorry can be a sensory achievement, in a way that merely hearing its sound is not. Through such sensory activities we can complete the natural function of the sense of hearing---not unlike the way lacing up a new shoe allows it first to function properly [I borrow the image from @oshaughnessy1972aa]. When humans in this way exploit the sounds that reach their ears, their hearing goes beyond the basic receptivity of the auditory sense. 
  
Frequently the way we listen out for things is guided by implicit questions or search tasks, as we could put it. Auditory perception of our environment is a clear case in which gaining information can make you more sensitive to the various audible particulars in your environment. Because you already know roughly what kind of sound you are hearing, you know what to listen out for. By knowing what you are listening to once you have achieved that state, you will be able to attend more determinately to what you hear, enabling you to hear more and discover more specific things. In this way, hearing things beyond the sounds that reach your ear depends to some extent on knowledge of the world, and this again brings out the prominent role of perceptual activity.
 
In all this, I am talking about perceiving particulars. Hearing a cat is not just a kind of epistemic (or 'propositional') hearing. That is, we can hear more than just _that_ a sound is of a cat, or _that_ the cat is in the room [the relation between perceptual activities and epistemic perception is the main concern of @crowther2009aa]. No doubt such epistemic hearing does occur; you can indeed come to learn new facts through hearing. Yet my argument here identifies a form of perception that seems more fundamental. We can only hear that such-and-such is the case, or hear what something is doing, by hearing some particular thing or other. Indeed, it is natural to think that hearing that the cat broke the vase is rooted in an experience of hearing particulars that are not themselves sounds: you hear the cat, you hear its running through the room, its jumping on the table, and you hear the vase when it lands and shatters into fragments on the wooden floor.

Hearing distal bodies at least typically involves some form of perceptual activity. However, there is no reason to infer that this reflects a universal principle of distal perception. Hearing distal bodies tends to depend on perceptual activity in a way that vision does not. In vision, many philosophers think, merely being in a state of seeing suffices for vision of a distal, material world. "With sight," Hans Jonas writes, "all I have to do is open my eyes, and the world is there, as it was all the time" [@jonas1954aa, p. 512]. Suppose that each sense has an associated 'field' such that, as soon as items happen to be within it, they are perceived. On that presupposition, Jonas' brings out that the items within your field of vision can be concrete, distal bodies. Suppose that in your bedroom at night someone suddenly turns on a light bulb. The bulb is something that can fall in your field of vision. It seems that, as soon as the receptivity of your eyes is functioning properly, you cannot but see that bulb. Getting that bulb into view requires no active direction of your gaze; it is hardly a sensory achievement. The sense of sight _per se_ is receptive to the distal, material world.

Cases of hearing concrete bodies and seeing them differ subtly but importantly. The sole occupants of the 'sensory field' of hearing are sounds. This is why hearing more than just sound typically involves at least some active engagement with the things that lie beyond it. Ordinarily this kind of engagement is largely unreflective, but it stands out clearly when we encounter unfamiliar sounds. An unfamiliar sound at first may seem detached from the rest of our perceived surroundings, and forces us to listen more carefully. Placing the sound requires a quick auditory search, in which we tune our ears to the object or event from which the sound springs [see @crowther2010aa for a discussion of how these perceptual activities may affect how it is to have such episodes]. In this way, active listening plays its part in a broader pattern of searching and mining our surroundings for perceptual encounters with objects and features that would have gone unperceived otherwise [cf. @johnston2006aa]. 

As I have explicated here, auditory perception can be of more than just sounds. More specifically, sounds enable us to listen to things wholly distinct from them, and so make mundane objects and events audible. This mediating role of sounds is manifest in experience. Making something else perceptible is a defining characteristic of perceptual mediators. Perceptual mediators confer perceptibility on objects wholly distinct from them, and so enable us to perceive those things despite the fact that there are wholly distinct from them. My discussion of auditory perception has established that the notion of perceptual mediation is in principle viable, and finds actual realisation in the sensory modality of hearing. Uncovering the perceptual mediators our environment has on offer is of central importance to the philosophy of perception. I will argue that it is also crucial for understanding visual representation. As I will show in the next section, the mediating role of sounds can give a representational dimension to perception. If that is right, then it opens the way for a powerful account of representation by means of images.

## Representation in perception

Listening to material bodies like coaches and cats, or to physical events such as bar fights, does not depend on these objects of perception being actually present in our environment. Instead, when they are audible, they are audible solely via sounds. Their sounds, when they reach our ears, can make these objects and events audible to us. That auditory perception does not depend on the presence of some of its potential objects may not stand out clearly in everyday experience. At least typically, what we hear is located somewhere in our surroundings and likely to be perceived via other sensory modalities too, vision in particular [the relative dominace of vision is illustrated nicely in the 'ventrilloquist effect', see @bertelson1999aa]. It is very common for people to see an object while they hear it. But it is an important consequence of the mediated structure of auditory perception that hearing objects strictly requires only the presence of sound. 

Examples can bring this out well. The clearest of these have only become available after Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville, and later Thomas Edison, conducted their pioneering work on technologies of sound reproduction. The late nineteenth century invention of phonograph cylinders enabled sounds produced at a specific moment in history to be captured, stored, and played back at a later time [cf. @sterne2003aa]. A contemporary playback of Scott de Martinville's rendition of the French song "Au Clair de la Lune", recorded on 9 April 1860, offers a clear case where you hear some thing or someone not present to the senses [some philosophers have observed this point, see e.g. @gregory2013aa, p. 17]. 

The key point I want to bring out is this. Hearing's independence from at least some of its objects is not exceptional, but part of the very structure of mediated perception. I think this points to a further step. Because mediated perception has this structure, it is most adequate to think of cases of hearing material bodies as _representational_.

To find out what had happened in the Boeing 737 that crashed near Pittsburgh on 8 September 1994, a team of audio forensic investigators played back the cockpit voice recorder that was retrieved after the accident. The team was particularly interested in a malfunctioning of the plane's rudders. Hence, it is unlikely that they listened merely to the sounds reproduced by their playback equipment. Indeed, they found out that the rudder's eventual jamming was not due to inept operation of controls, but occurred because of mechanical obstruction. Their observation required a careful, well-informed 'mining' of an auditory scene that was made audible again by replaying the recording. This activity of listening crucially relies on an ability to attend to specific objects and properties that are made audible through a recording. The investigators' finding was made possible because they were able to single out specific items audible via the recorded sound: the plane's rudder, as it locked in its extreme position, and the members of the flight crew as they manipulated the controls.

The malfunctioning aeroplane parts and crew members were audible months after the craft had crashed. They were audible because of what had made them audible that day in 1994: their sounds. Listening to those instruments was not in any way an illusory or non-veridical experience. To the contrary, the judgements based on it turned out to be spot on. And although the forensic team exercised their capacity to hear things by means of those sounds with expert precision, they did not engage in anything beyond the pale of ordinary auditory discrimination. This example brings out dramatically a rather mundane point: the success conditions for mediated listening do not include an object's presence.

Sound reproduction techniques allow us to recreate the conditions sufficient for hearing concrete bodies and physical events. Precisely because of this, also in listening to a recording we can focus our perceptual attention on something that goes beyond the heard sound itself. This is especially easy if the sounds are of a kind our ears are already attuned to. This everyday ability was exploited, both scientifically and commercially, as soon as the technology to reproduce sounds was invented. As Jonathan Sterne describes, very early on the genre of 'descriptive specialities' came into fashion---a precursor of the still familiar radio play. In those recordings of sounds, distributed for amusement, events were re-enacted for a recording device using a variety of techniques and tricks to increase a naturalistic listening experience. Descriptive specialities allowed listeners to have the experience of hearing events they perhaps only ever read about in encyclopedias, newspapers, or novels [cf. @sterne2003aa, p. 245].

Why would such perception be representational, as I suggested earlier? This is because cases in which we can perceive things in their absence have typically been understood as instances of representation. The concept of representation has taken centre stage in recent work in the philosophy of perception. The representational dimension of perception reveals itself in cases where, allegedly, things sensorily appear to a perceiver that are not present to the senses, or where we have reason to think that the perceptual state a perceiver is in does not depend on such presence [@rowlands2015aa, p. 6; @siegel2010aa, ch. 6]. Wherever a kind of perception does not require some or all of its objects to be present, we may take it to involve a form of representation of those objects. Hence we can accept the following as a sufficient condition for perceptual representation: something is represented in someone's perception if they perceive something that is not present to the senses, or where their perceptual state does not depend on such presence.

Now of course this raises a difficult question. What is it for something to be present to the senses? The question is difficult, because it is at least natural to think that as soon as something is perceived, it is thereby present to us, at least in some way. Was their hearing the rudder not sufficient ground for thinking that, even after the plane had crashed, the rudder was present to the audio forensic investigators? (Perhaps in this way a distant star may be present to the eye, even if it is very far away.) The point is well taken. Just as there is undeniably a sense in which that rudder was not present to them, there is an intuitive sense in which, by means of those sounds, it did become present. This tension is no more than a consequence of the somewhat see-saw way philosophers have conceived of perceptual representation. It seems to have worked its way into the very catchphrase they have come to use for representation: _presence in absence_. 

What matters is that some objects are able to determine in part the way the world appears to us in perceptual experience, whereas other objects are not. Perceiving something entails having a kind of sensory experience. In such a sensory experience, things appear to one, and they appear in a certain way. When you stare at a green wall in front of you, it is the greenness of the wall that in part determines the way the wall appears to you. Typically, the wall looks green to you because it is in fact green. An object or scene may be understood to be perceptually present to you if its properties play a role in determining how things appear to you. As Mark Johnston has characterised this understanding of presence, it is the way in which some item---object, quality and so on---discloses some aspect of its nature [@johnston2007aa, p. 233]. Whereas the green wall and even the distant star disclose some aspects of their nature in this way, the rudder the team heard was unable to do this; its sounds did that _for_ it. In this way the rudder the team was able to hear was not present to the senses, but represented to the team by its sound.

The mediated structure of auditory perception allows for sounds to be conveyed, reproduced, or more generally to recur in ways that make some things audible, or audible anew. Sounds can make these things heard, while figuring importantly independently of those things they make heard. This is why we may conceive of the sounds in our environment as potential auditory representations of a world that lies beyond them. Those heard sounds can play a determining role in the exercise of our capacity to listen to things that are not sounds [that they play this perceptual role is not infrequently overlooked, see e.g. @tolliver2007aa, p. 143]. 

Just as with other perceptual capacities, we can naturally conceive of the capacity for representational perception as only exercised in response to something. We may think of them as reactive capacities along the lines of Aristotle's theory of perception (I discussed this in chapter 1, p. \pageref{dis:reactive}). Sound figures as an essential cog in the machinery of representation in auditory perception. In general, what we can hear is at least in part determined by the audible character of the sounds we perceive. Moreover, precisely because sounds are wholly distinct from the concrete bodies they allow us to perceive, those bodies themselves simply lack an audible character---hence material bodies and most physical events are not audible as such [cf. @jonas1954aa, p. 514].

Of course, technologies of sound reproduction have only become available relatively late in the history of hearing. But this by no means implies that the possibilities they reveal are not integral to what it is to hear concrete bodies and physical events. The sense of hearing enables us to perceive things not present to it. This means that perceptual representation finds a natural home in this sensory modality. 

It is not hard to see a natural tie between perceptual mediation and representation, so understood. That hearing is representational in the way I discussed is due to the structure of the perceptual situation of hearing an object. Note, I do not claim that this is the only way of thinking about representation. Hidé Ishiguro has brought out well that philosophers have considered quite distinct phenomena to be in some way representational [@ishiguro1994aa]. More recently, Mark Rowlands expresses his despair at the unhelpful equivocality of the concept of representation in philosophy [@rowlands2015aa]. Yet, I think that reflection on auditory perception helps us clarify an interesting form of perceptual representation; a form that both  Ishiguro and Rowlands consider to be central.
 
Let me emphasise that the understanding of representation I propose here contrasts with 'representationalism' or 'intentionalism' about perception, as recent philosophers have used those terms. By calling mediate perception 'representational', I am not suggesting that mediate perception does not at all depend on actual objects in our environment. I do not assume that such perception involves merely a 'construction' or 'mental model' or 'representational content' of our environment. Certain philosophers do think this. They think that perception as such does not depend on actual objects in our environment. As Tim Crane explains that view,

  > the intentionalist theory of perception denies that the essential phenomenal character of a perceptual experience is essentially determined (wholly or partly) by the real objects which are perceived. This is because it holds that perception and hallucination are states with the same phenomenal character and therefore of the same mental kind; but in the case of hallucination there is no real object being perceived. [@crane2011aa]

When I suggest that your hearing the lorry drive by is representational, I do not deny that the character of your experience of hearing the lorry is determined (wholly or partly) by actual audible particulars in your environment. Indeed, I take it to be manifest that the sounds we hear do at least in part determine that character [cf. @nudds2014aa]. Those sounds are there in our environment, I presume, and I find it at least natural to assume that our auditory perception depends on their presence. (Strictly, however, the model of representation as perceptual mediation I propose remains neutral on the larger question whether perception or sensory experience as such is 'intentional' in the way Crane describes.)

By reflecting on auditory perception, I have uncovered the possibility of perceptual mediation. I have now also shown how perceptual mediation opens up the possibility of representation in perception---perception of the absent. If something functions as a perceptual mediator, then it is a vehicle for perceptual representation. Now I am able to turn to visual perception, and explicate possibilities that seemed unavailable earlier. In the next section I will show how visual representation by means of images is no more than the visual occurrence of perceptual mediation. 

## Images

In 1792 the French Academy of Sciences employed the visual artist Pierre-Joseph Redouté to produce a series of botanical watercolours. Praised for their accuracy, Redouté's meticulous renderings of blooms were expressly designed for scientific instruction and education [cf. @mallary1986aa]. Many of the plants and flowers he painted were hard to conserve, grew abroad, or blossomed only for a very brief period. In part by co-operating with learned communities, Redouté produced botanical images that still successfully function as substitutes for real-life study and botanical observation [see @kusukawa2012aa, chs 7-8 for a discussion of similar examples of early collaborations between modern science and art]. 

Take for instance the image he painted of a _Myosotis Scorpioides_, a small flower better known as the Forget-me-not (Fig. \ref{fig:redoute}). It is natural to conceive of such a drawing, or a good reproduction of it, as allowing us visually to scrutinise the flower's anatomy, and look at the form and arrangement of its distinctive blueish petals.

That we naturally conceive of Redouté's watercolours as fostering visual scrutiny of plants and their parts suggests we think of these images as making these plants visible to us. No doubt this understanding is to a large extent rooted in the fact that we find ourselves able to engage with those represented plants in a visual way. Presented with Redouté's work, we seem able to look at features of these plants; trace their shapes with our eyes; visually compare the relative proportions and colours of their stems and flowers. No doubt that students at the time could see that it was a mere drawing they were presented with. If they so liked, they could also specifically look at and appreciate these drawings for what they were, perhaps coming to admire Redouté's technique in creating them. Yet this does not take away that Redouté's plate seems to afford an opportunity for perceiving a Forget-me-not. 

As I noted before, philosophers have found these data puzzling, because they conceive of sight as obviously dependent on the presence of its objects. In \autoref{chap:problem} I argued that the otherwise attractive assumption that Redouté's prints make those flowers visible becomes philosophically suspect because of specific assumptions about vision. Although it may seem natural to think that his watercolours enable us to look at flowers, philosophers moved by a specific theory of vision have simply denied that visual representation of _that_ sort is possible. 

We can now see how this is reaction is too quick. Although not presupposed in our ordinary vision of the material world, the possibility of perceptual mediation is genuine. This genuine possibility explains how Redouté's watercolours can succeed in making absent flowers visible to the observant student. They can make those flowers visible, because those watercolours can play a mediating role in visual perception. 

Is it surprising that this explanation of how images can make absent scenes visible has typically been overlooked in recent debates about images? Not really. This is because the possibility and reality of perceptual mediation is not manifest to us when we merely reflect on what it is to see. We naturally conceive of vision as affording us awareness of the material world around us. Rarely do we consider this perception to require awareness of some further item that intervenes between us and the objects we see. As long as we take vision to be the model of perception, it may be tempting to think of perception simply as an immediate mode of awareness of the world around us [for the observation that for too long philosophy has had a visuocentric bias, see @ocallaghan2018aa, p. 316]. However, reflection on perception in other sensory modalities, audition in particular, helps uncover the possibility of perception that is not reducible to an immediate awareness of the world. The reality of perceptual mediation becomes manifest to us when we reflect on how we hear and listen to the world around us. The very possibility of perceptual mediation is crucial, and our sensory lives would be impoverished without it.

Redouté's images can function as perceptual mediators in vision. This is why budding botanists can, in the comfort of their studies, week in week out, scrutinise the rare flowers he painted, peer at their many-coloured blooms, and admire their frail, delicate anatomy. Recall, an object functions as a perceptual mediator if perceiving it enables us perceptually to attend to some thing wholly distinct from it. The flower whose petals we admire is wholly distinct from Redouté's painted image, in that it is neither identical to the image, nor has any parts in common with it, nor is it a property of the image. There simply is no flower in front of us when we are just presented with this image. Nor is part of the image a part of a flower, as if some petals were glued to a page. Nonetheless, by virtue of seeing Redouté's watercolour, we can look at, and so perceptually to attend to, a flower. The image functions as a perceptual mediator, and as such makes the flowers that Redouté painted visible. Especially in a cold, Parisian winter, Redouté's prints made visible what otherwise would have remained invisible to many.

It can be tempting to use observed similarities between phenomena to infer categorical conclusions about those phenomena. If I am right, then images and sounds figure in perception in a structurally similar way. Yet it would be mistaken to conclude that images function as mediators in vision because of their similarity to sounds. Arguments from analogy are at best suggestive, and inferences based on them cannot go beyond probability without fallacy [see @walton2014aa for a recent review of variations of this form of argument]. Thomas Reid discusses how noticing a strong resemblance between earth and other celestial bodies' orbital or atmospheric conditions leads people to speculate about extraterrestrial life [@reid1895aa, p. 24]. Space agencies still owe part of their funding to this tendency. Yet Reid rightly points out that such inductive analogies can at best establish likelihood, never categorical claims.

I do not suggest that it is probable that Redouté's images function in vision as perceptual mediators. My claim is a categorical one. It is based on a more general understanding of what is possible in perception. It is a conclusion drawn in part on conceptual grounds. Reflection on what it is to listen to material bodies provided a well-defined criterion for the mediating function I attribute to both sounds and images. An object functions as a perceptual mediator if perceiving it enables us to attend perceptually to some object or event wholly distinct from it. Given how successful Redouté's watercolours are as substitutes for real life study and observation, to my mind it is clear that this criterion applies to images.

We have good grounds to assume that the mediating function of images is perfectly general, and is not restricted to scientific contexts, or contexts in which observation serves an epistemic purpose. Indeed, being an image _just is_ being a perceptual mediator in vision, regardless of the specific scientific, communicative or aesthetic practices in which we use it (I will come back to this distinction in \autoref{chap:structure}). Consider a very different example, Paul Cézanne's unfinished masterpiece _Les Grandes Baigneuses_ (Fig. \ref{fig:cezanne}). 

Cézanne's painting may strike you as no more than a jumble of painted fields, especially if you merely see it from the corner of your eye. Such a superficial view on the painting is likely to be short-lived. The stark contours of legs and arms and buttocks almost hurl the gist of the scene at us: a chaotic group of nudes. So far so good. But how many? Where? What are they doing? It is as if Cézanne mixed such questions with his oils. Just as the eye distinguishes tones and hues, it is naturally set to search for their answers. Cézanne often plays on how visual individuation is an active process. The bathers are visible, but ill-defined. Discerning individual bodies requires us to retrace their boundaries---an ocular analysis. On the other hand, their surrounds require the different treatment of successive scanning. We need to built up a comprehensive view of the landscape, and here the group's dynamic placement is a natural aid. As Adrian Stokes writes of the group, "[t]hey absorb, and in absorbing rule, monumental, the environment" [-@stokes1972aa]. The human form points us to features of the landscape. In so opening ourselves to their cues, our sensibility for human gazes is of particular importance. Self-consciously following Titian's example, Cézanne exploits the play of eyes of his figures. It is a powerful device, as it draws on our sensitivity to visible social clues. We cannot but follow the gazes of the seated figures, our eyes stumbling upon an indistinct shape (a goose? a dog?) which they stroke from all sides. Yet, at the same time, the social dynamic interrupts our scanning of environment; suddenly our gaze interlocks with that of the right figure leaning against the tree. Someone is looking at us too.

Here we have a purely aesthetic example, in contrast with the partly scientific one discussed above. Our eyes move across the panel, but this movement is guided not by the panel, but by the scene it represents [a fact brought out well in eye-tracking studies of how we look at images; see @yarbus1967aa; @deangelus2009aa]. Our eyes are drawn in by the painting, looking from figure to figure. We visually trace the contours and outlines of a group in a landscape. Our exploration can seek for a narrative, or it can be guided merely by formal features, or an urge to identify, or all of these. What matters is that in every instance our exploration serves a crucial perceptual function. In our activity we uncover the represented scene. It is by looking at the painting that we get the figures that Cézanne set out to represent in view. In general, it is only because we are able to look at some scene wholly distinct from the image that the scene it represents becomes visible to us.

<!-- This could use some clarification, I now see. It ties in with the previous discussion about sounds, and the way we need activity to move beyond them in perception: it is possible perceptually to attend to a sound without yet attending to its source. Similarly, it is possible to attend perceptually to an image without yet attending to what it represents. In both cases, merely by becoming present to us they do not yet discharge their representational potential. -->
Here perceptual activity plays a central role in determining the objects of sight. The centrality of our activity of looking in our engagement with images more generally is a faint but unmistakable echo of the theories of vision I discussed in \autoref{chap:problem} (p. \pageref{activevision}). However, I do not assume vision is exclusively or even primarily active, as Kilwardby and Olivi did [for contemporary approximations of the idea, see @noe2004aa;@hutto2013aa]. Few today would deny that the material world can affect our perception and thinking. We naturally conceive of sight as a form of being receptive to a material world. To see the world around us, we think, it just needs to be there. When it comes to what one can see immediately, our perception does not constitutively depend on our sensory activity. My point is that things are different when it comes to perceptual representation---in this case, seeing things by means of images. I suggest that as soon as we perceive things by means of images, the story at least typically reverses: we can get something into view when we direct our perceptual attention. Our activity is able to carry our gaze beyond the image. Here lies the grain of truth in the Augustinian theories of vision. Sometimes things come into view only because of how we look at them. An image makes some further item visible, precisely because it offers us a way successfully to engage in perceptual activities directed at some further scene or item. This is a defining characteristic of perceptual mediators. Images can mediate vision, in that through our engagement with them they can make objects or scenes wholly distinct from them appear to sight.

That images invite and typically require this perceptual activity has been understood to be central to representation in the arts. Adrian Stokes emphasises how representational painting compels us actively to explore a represented scene in perception, 'feeling' our way around it. As he writes, 
    
> More clearly in naturalistic painting, the first test of its merit is the degree to which we become attached to the turn of the contours, the degree to which we are compelled to feel our way into spaces, whether populated or whether empty of shapes. This matter is at the heart of painting on a flat surface, distinguishing its appreciation from an apprehension of landscape itself which the eye constructs and contemplates without ado as a three-dimensional datum. [@stokes1965aa, p.27] 

Stokes uses the tactile metaphor of feeling our way into the space of a picture to capture our visual activity of exploring a scene that is merely represented by the image. In looking at the occupants of a represented scene, an image may require us actively to explore, uncover and reach for details not immediately given to us [the point is also emphasised in @collingwood1938aa, pp. 146-7]. In the passage, Stokes contrasts the way our visual activity brings a represented scene into view with the way we can see a landscape immediately when standing outside and looking at it. Of course we also attend to various details and actively scan when we look out on a natural scene. Yet when such a scene is immediately present to us, to see it does not require anything more of us than merely having our eyes open.

<!-- This merely restates the point. --> 
Often our directed perceptual activity contributes to what we perceive. Yet while in immediate perception such activity is optional, merely a useful guide, in the case of perceiving images it tends to become ineliminable. It enables us to move beyond what meets the eye, getting a represented scene into view. Cézanne's painting brings out the centrality of such activity even better than Redouté's relatively timid imagery. It makes an illustrative counterpart of the earlier example of tracking the destructive path of a cat in your living room. In the case of images, the explanation for why we can see a flower or a nude when we see an image most often is that we are able successfully to look at a flower, or at such a nude body, when we are presented with an image that represents it. What we manage to look at here would determine what we perceive. 

## The problem of visual opacity

The situation of hearing some distant body, such as hearing the bell of Bow Church, intrinsically comes with a repeatable element we could try to capture, recreate or imitate. As I explained above, whenever we hear a distant body or concrete event, we do so through some sound that reaches our ears. Sounds function as mediators. Technological advances have made sounds capturable, storable, and thereby reproducable. When we play back a sound recording, we make audible a sound that was audible on an earlier occasion [@martin2012aa]. Hearing that sound played back, we are put in a position to listen to objects or events from a situation in a possibly distant past. I showed that given this possibility, hearing things by means of sounds is best conceived of as representational. 

So far I have compared audition and vision. But audition is not the only sensory modality that manifestly relies on perceptual mediators. Arguably, olfactory perception of objects does so too. We can only smell something if we smell a scent. Just as the sounds that reach our ears, it seems natural to conceive of the scents that enter our nose as enabling us to perceive material particulars. In recent work Clare Batty has argued that in olfaction we indeed exploit the presence of scents to perceive distant material particulars by means of them [@batty2015aa]. If Batty is right, then also scents function as perceptual mediators. Can they be captured, recreated or imitated like sounds can? Currently we lack much of the technology to record mechanically particular scents in the way our iPhones can record sound. Still, like Grenouille in Süskind's _Das Parfum_, a skilled perfumer may succeed in recreating or inventing scents, and so perhaps enable us to smell whatever objects they wanted us to smell.

By contrast, sight does not seem to require perceptual mediators of the kind we find in audition and (perhaps) in olfactory experience. In reflecting on what it is to see, it is manifest that we do not normally perceive the distal world by means of some perceived intermediary that mediates between perceiver and distal world. No specific sort of object is necessarily seen in our visual perception of the world, something we must see before we can see anything else. In his discussion of the contrast between the visible and audible world, M.G.F. Martin observes that 

> we do not conceive of the visible world as offering us primary objects of visual awareness and attention distinct from concrete objects through which we come to see the concrete. [@martin2012aa]

This sets the sense of sight apart from the auditory and olfactory senses. Seeing a flower in a botanical garden does not require seeing some visual particular distinct from the flower. We do not require something we could potentially capture, recreate or imitate. [This is not to say that seeing does not involve light reaching our eyes. Of course it does. The point is that this light is not itself a necessary object of vision, _pace_ @oshaughnessy1985aa] Not every distant visible scene has a corresponding visual representation---a visible image---in the way sounds or smells make the material world audible or smellable. Sure, one could pick the flower itself, dry it, and put it on display. That would have enabled Parisians to observe the flower throughout the cold winter. But it wouldn't make the flower visible in its absence. On display would be just a flower, not a representation of a flower. As P.M.S Hacker puts it, "nothing in the domain of visibilia stands to seeing as sounds stand to hearing, smells to smelling..." [@hacker1987aa, p. 209]. 

Visual mediators are exceptional, and go beyond the natural way sight presents its objects. A concrete object's visibility, unlike its audibility or smellability, as such does not entail the existence of any perceptual mediators. This is rooted in the nature of the sense of sight; it is because of how seeing 'works', so to say. Should that make us suspicious of the kind of mediated visual representation I purport to have identified? If material bodies---including paintings and drawings---can be seen immediately, does this not mean that all visual perception must be immediate? That is, does it not rule out the possibility of mediation in visual perception as I identified it? An objection along these lines is developed by Brian O'Shaughnessy. According to O'Shaughnessy, vision is immediate because it is _directional_. He thinks this directional character of sight rules out that images, themselves visible bodies, could make something wholly distinct from them visible.

In order to represent at all, images must themselves be visible objects. O'Shaughnessy argues that images, as visible objects, occlude some of our field of view whenever we see them. This, he thinks, entails that their appearance, instead of making other items visible, can only prevent those other items from being seen. Images, such as paintings or photographs, are not transparent, but opaque. If they are opaque, they can at best block other items from view, not make them visible. As O'Shaughnessy puts this:

> If two objects are located at the same moment in time on the same spatial line coming from the eye, the only way visibility of both could be realised would be if the nearer of the two objects was what we call '_transparent_': if the near object is not transparent and occupies some given sector of the visual field, then it must _obscure_ the remoter object.[@oshaughnessy2003aa, p. 175]

O'Shaughnessy thinks that if, by looking in a certain direction, the first thing that appears to sight is opaque, then another thing wholly distinct from it cannot appear in that same direction. He presents this as an utterly general principle of vision. It is how vision works as a distal sense. That Byng Place visually appears to me when I turn my eyes eastwards is because the window next to me is transparent, not opaque. Had it been wholly opaque, as a painting or photograph on that wall would have been, then the Byng Place coffee stand would have remained invisible from where I am.  

O'Shaughnessy assumes that sight is essentially directional. Whenever we see some particular thing, we see it down an axis in space, a line commonly described as a line of sight. O'Shaughnessy assumes that any object of vision must appear to sight in a specific direction out from us in tridimensional space [@oshaughnessy2003aa, p. 175]. He takes this as a precondition for vision's being a distal sense. And so if the bathers in Cézanne's painting can genuinely appear to us by virtue of seeing their image, as I suggest, then they could only do so by appearing in exactly the same direction as the visible canvas. 

Note, however, that direction is not location. Something can be visible along a line of sight without being located along that line of sight---as when your face becomes visible in the direction of the bathroom mirror, without being located in the direction of that mirror. Similarly, there is no reason to suppose that Cézanne's bathers must be located somewhere in the direction of Cézanne's canvas in order to appear along that line of sight. (The suggestion that images and mirrors present us with a distinct, 'virtual' space seems to me based on a tacit conflation of direction and location.)

If O'Shaughnessy is right, then it seems that Cézanne's painting could only render visible an otherwise invisible group of people if it were transparent [or if, for some reason, the concepts of transparency and opacity did not apply to it; O'Shaughnessy himself thinks that this is true of non-extended sense data, which he assigns a crucial role in perception, see also @oshaughnessy2000aa]. But paintings are not transparent, because they are opaque. 

The problem for the view about visual representation I defend arises because the following three premises seem to be inconsistent (the third premise naturally follows from what I have argued above).  

1. If, by looking in a specific direction, the first thing that appears to sight is opaque, then another thing wholly distinct from the first cannot appear to sight in that same direction.
2. Images are opaque.
3. If, by looking in a specific direction, the first thing that appears to sight is an image, then another thing wholly distinct from the first can appear to sight in that same direction.

I take it that O'Shaughnessy is right about the relation between directionality and opacity, and so I accept the first premise. Am I then committed to denying the second premise? Must I deny that images are opaque, appearances to the contrary?

Denying that images are opaque need not be incoherent. Kendall Walton has suggested that at least some images make things visible because, appearances to the contrary, they are transparent. He claims that this holds for photographs. Walton argues for this claim on the basis of similarities between the photographic mechanism and the workings of other optical instruments, such as telescopes, periscopes and ordinary mirrors [@walton1984aa]. Walton's suggestion is revisionary, and has been met with some resistance. Yet what matters most for the current discussion is that it conflicts with the idea of images as perceptual mediators. According to Walton, a photograph makes some scene distinct from it visible to the extent that the photograph itself is _not_ perceptible, but transparent. Yet something functions as a perceptual mediator only to the extent that it is perceptible. The opacity of images as mediators is not an contingent feature; it is necessary. By giving up the assumption that images are opaque, we would be denying that they meet a necessary requirement for perceptual mediation. [Michael @newall2010aa, argues that images, though not in fact transparent, at least look to be transparent. Even if that were right, which I doubt, it would not avoid O'Shaughnessy's objection.] 

The way to avoid O'Shaughnessy's objection without giving up the opacity of images, is to turn back to the structure of the visual modality. In vision, as in audition and olfaction, we find perceptual mediators. Mediators in audition are sounds, mediators in olfaction are smells. In vision, I have argued, images fulfil a mediating role. However, there are nonetheless sharp structural differences between these various sense modalities. As I mentioned above, sounds and smells are sensible particulars that figure in any act of hearing or smelling. Images figure only exceptionally in vision. Images can mediate perception, but visual perception of the bodies and events around us does not depend on that possibility. This allows us to draw a sharp line between vision on the one hand, and sensory modalities such as audition and olfaction on the other. That images figure only exceptionally in vision implies that you can see one and the same object both immediately and mediately. You can see it immediately by encountering it in real life, but also mediately when you encounter an image of that object. At least for us, vision is what we could call a _heterogeneous_ sensory modality.

\label{def:heterogeneity}

> __Sensory heterogeneity__ A sensory modality is heterogenous if and only if in that modality we can perceive one and the same item both immediately and mediately. <!-- Note, the biconditional makes it a technical notion, for it excludes other intuitive ways we could call a modality heterogeneous. --> 

\noindent By contrast, in auditory perception only sounds can be heard immediately, whereas objects and ordinary events can only be heard mediately, namely by means of sounds. We cannot hear one and the same item both immediately and mediately. Hence, audition is a _homogeneous_ sensory modality---a sensory modality that is not heterogeneous. 

If sight is heterogeneous in the way I suggest, then the problem with O'Shaughnessy's objection becomes clear. It is that the first and last premise can only both be true if they equivocate two ways something can appear to sight. All premises are true only if we read

1. If, by looking in a specific direction, the first thing that appears to sight is opaque, then another thing wholly distinct from the first cannot _immediately_ appear to sight in that same direction.
2. Images are opaque.
3. If, by looking in a specific direction, the first thing that appears to sight is an image, then another thing wholly distinct from the first can _mediately_ appear to sight in that same direction.

The conflict disappears. Reflecting on the way vision works as a distal sense, we may very well accept that, indeed, opaque objects prevent further items from appearing to sight immediately. Yet, as soon as we accept that in visual perception we can draw on capacities foreign to the sense as such, we see how, when opaque objects function as mediators, they may expand what is visible along a single line of sight. 

Suppose you look at a large television screen, presenting you with the televised image of a group of people scuffling. And suppose that behind the screen there are persons exactly like those shown on the screen, doing the same things. The image on the screen is a wholly opaque surface, distinct from the group of people it represents. As the opaque visible item it is, the screen obscures from sight whatever is located in the same direction. Yet given that it is an image, it can make the group of people visible in a mediated way. Although it prevents the group from appearing to sight immediately, it allows the fighting people to appear mediately, because of the way the visible image can function in our experience of the situation. It enables us to direct our gaze and look at a group of people and their struggles as they unfold.

O'Shaughnessy writes about the television image that despite the fact that it 'shows' the televised situation in one sense, and despite the overlap in cognitive utility between our seeing the image and our seeing that situation 'in the flesh', it is only when we look at the scene immediately that we are actually able to 'set our eyes upon' that scene [@oshaughnessy2003aa, p. 180]. He takes this to prove that the way the television image presents us with the visual appearance of the scuffle does not amount to its visibility. If I am right, this is a mistake. As soon as we acknowledge that vision allows for a special kind of perceptual contraband---a kind of sensory appearance foreign to it, inessential to its normal functioning---we may accept that an image does confer a distinct kind of visibility on whatever it represents to the eye. To be sure, when a scene appears to us representationally in vision, we to that extent precisely do not perceive it 'in the flesh', and all we actually 'set our eyes upon' is an image. This however does not take away that the scene does appear to us. It appears to sight in a way that belongs only naturally to those senses that require perceptual mediators to figure in any instance of their exercise. 

I accept that vision's heterogeneous structure is not the first thing on most people's minds when they reflect on what we could possibly come to see. Few will conceive of the visible world as offering us both immediate perceptual awareness of the objects and events in our environment, as well as a mediated form of vision that exploits some image we are presented with. However, that something is not obvious does of course not mean it does not occur.

## Representational appearances

<!-- State the central claim in brief -->
The central thesis I have argued for in this chapter is that images are perceptual mediators for the sense of sight. This answers the question we were left with after having set aside the copy theory of visual representation. How is it possible for an image to make an absent scene visible? The answer is that images can do this, because they bring to vision the opportunity for mediated perception. When an image functions as a mediator in someone's perception of the world, it makes some object or scene wholly distinct from it appear to sight. It can do so in the object's absence. This explains how images represent.

<!-- Explore what this means for our conception of perception -->
If what I have argued is right, then it means that perception---vision in particular---does not require the presence of all of its objects. Charles Travis writes that 

> _perception_, as such, simply places our surroundings in view, affords us awareness of them [...] It confronts us with what is there...[@travis2013aa, p. 65?]
 
\noindent We can now see that thinking of perception as merely a mode of awareness of what is there is too simple. Undoubtedly some instances of perception simply place our surroundings in view. Moreover, I agree that it is natural to assume that vision always brings at least some of our surroundings into view. To see is always to become aware of something that is present to the eye. But as soon as we take account of the possibility of perceptual mediation, we see that perception---even visual perception---sometimes does more. When we are confronted with a sound or a smell, or indeed an image, some wholly distinct object or scene may be audible, smellable, or visible to us. This would enable us to perceive something that need not actually be present there at all. 

<!-- highlight the value of crossmodal comparison -->
It is perhaps telling that Travis restricts his discussion of perception to observations about vision. He does not consider other sensory modalities. In particular, Travis omits reference to those senses, such as audition and olfaction, that for their functioning as distal senses depend on mediators. Yet it is precisely this possibility of mediation that our perception of images exploits. It is tempting to think that precisely because of his focus on vision, Travis was bound from the outset to reach only a partial understanding of what visual perception, as such, can do.

To my mind, it is clear that philosophical inquiry about visual representation should start to consider the role images can play in perception. I have identified that role, and have shown how this fits with our everyday engagement with the images we know. Images function as perceptual mediators, and as such enable us to perceive the scenes they represent mediately. This leaves it open how exactly we should conceive of mediate perception, as a state of sensory awareness. What is the difference between merely hearing a rattling sound and hearing a coach by means of that sound? What is the difference between merely seeing the paint on the surface of Cézanne's _Les Grandes Baigneuses_, and seeing a group of nudes by means of that paint? Some have suggested that this difference is not genuinely sensory. They think that to perceive such a group of nudes by means of an image is at least in part constituted by some non-sensory act of cognition. In the next chapter I will show how we need not accept that view. Instead, I will defend an understanding of mediate perception as a purely sensory state. Instead of relying on non-sensory or quasi-sensory effects of thought or cognition, coming to see a painted surface as an image consists in no more than discovering a previously unseen aspect of the visible world.
